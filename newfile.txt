RISC Processor
RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer Processor, 
a microprocessor architecture with a simple collection and highly customized set of instructions.
It is built to minimize the instruction execution time by optimizing and limiting the number of instructions. 
It means each instruction cycle requires only one clock cycle, and each cycle contains three parameters: fetch, decode and execute. 
The RISC processor is also used to perform various complex instructions by combining them into simpler ones. 
RISC chips require several transistors, making it cheaper to design and reduce the execution time for instruction.

Examples of RISC processors are SUN's SPARC, PowerPC, Microchip PIC processors, RISC-V.
