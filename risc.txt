Some important features of RISC processors are:

One cycle execution time: For executing each instruction in a computer, the RISC processors require one CPI (Clock per cycle). 
And each CPI includes the fetch, decode and execute method applied in computer instruction.
Pipelining technique: The pipelining technique is used in the RISC processors to execute multiple parts or stages of instructions to perform more efficiently.
A large number of registers: RISC processors are optimized with multiple registers that can be used to store instruction and quickly respond to the computer and minimize interaction with computer memory.
It supports a simple addressing mode and fixed length of instruction for executing the pipeline.
It uses LOAD and STORE instruction to access the memory location.
Simple and limited instruction reduces the execution time of a process in a RISC.
