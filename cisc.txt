The CISC Stands for Complex Instruction Set Computer, developed by the Intel. 
It has a large collection of complex instructions that range from simple to very complex and specialized in the assembly language level, 
Which takes a long time to execute the instructions. 
So, CISC approaches reducing the number of instruction on each program and ignoring the number of cycles per instruction.
It emphasizes to build complex instructions directly in the hardware because the hardware is always faster than software. 
However, CISC chips are relatively slower as compared to RISC chips but use little instruction than RISC. 
Examples of CISC processors are VAX, AMD, Intel x86 and the System/360
